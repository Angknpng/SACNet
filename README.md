## The Proposed Unaligned RGBT Salient Object Detection Dataset

### UVT2000

We construct a novel benchmark dataset, containing 2000 unaligned visible-thermal image pairs directly captured from various real-word scenes, to facilitate research on alignment-free RGBT SOD.

### Dataset Statistics and Comparisons

We analyze the proposed ReDWeb-S datset from several statistical aspects and also conduct a comparison between ReDWeb-S and other existing RGB-D SOD datasets.
